## Monolithic and Microservice Architecture


| Monolithic Architecture      | Microservice Architecture |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Traditional model of software/application program which is self contained.      | Modern way of software development that depends on modular component. |
| Independent from any other application.   | Dependent & modular but single module failure will not effect the whole application        |
| Singluar code base.   | Different plugins could have different code base        |
| Update requires to change in the entire stack.   | Easy update & speedy deployment        |
| Time Consuming.   | Much more fast & efficient.        |
| Difficult to pin point the problems for large problem.   | Easy debugging & code management.        |

## Virtualization v/s Containerization 

| Virtualization      | Containerization |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Partitioning a physical server into multiple virtual servers.      | Bundling the application code along with the libraries, configuration files, and dependencies required for the application to run cross-platform.  |
| Hypervisor Layer performs all the task.   | Docker Daemon/Container Engine Layer performs all the task        |
| Hypervisor creates an abstract layer on the computer hardware, handles resource allocation, and monitors the virtual machines.   | Piece of software that accepts user requests, including command line options, pulls images, and from the end user's perspective runs the container.        |
| Deploys an actual virtual server on top of hardware resouces.   | Creates an environment for an application to run.      |
