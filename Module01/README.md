## Monolithic and Microservice Architecture


| Monolithic Architecture      | Microservice Architecture |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Traditional model of software/application program which is self contained.      | Modern way of software development that depends on modular component. |
| Independent from any other application.   | Dependent & modular but single module failure will not effect the whole application        |
| Singluar code base.   | Different plugins could have different code base        |
| Update requires to change in the entire stack.   | Easy update & speedy deployment        |
| Time Consuming.   | Much more fast & efficient.        |
| Difficult to pin point the problems for large problem.   | Easy debugging & code management.        |
