| Independent from any other application.   | Dependent & modular but single module failure will not effect the whole application        |
| Singluar code base.   | Different plugins could have different code base        |
| Update requires to change in the entire stack.   | Easy update & speedy deployment        |
| Time Consuming.   | Much more fast & efficient.        |
